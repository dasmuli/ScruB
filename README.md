# ScruB
ScruB is a lean personal and small team scrum-like task planer. It is based on node and html 5. See demo.

The demo is available on my dynamic dns server http://zerozerozero.dd-dns.de. I use this site for my small projects, so data backup is given.

As this was a test project to get to know node and socket.io, the code is rather sub standard. But as the app works and being quite fast for a slow low power arm server, I am rather happy with the result.
